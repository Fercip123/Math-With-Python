# Math-With-Python
A personal collection of mathematical concepts implemented in Python, focused on building a foundation for **NeuroAI** research.
## Contents
- **/Calculus**: Visualization of derivatives and gradients (NumPy, Matplotlib).
- **/Linear-Algebra**: Matrix operations and vector spaces (Coming Soon).
## Goal
To master the mathematical rigor required for graduate studies at **Kyoto University**.
## Tech
- Python 3.13
- NumPy & Matplotlib
## AI Ethics & Transparency
This project is developed with the assistance of **Gemini (Google AI)** for code optimization and conceptual explanations. I use AI as a "thought partner" to bridge my understanding of abstract math into functional code.
